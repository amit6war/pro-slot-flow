# Enhanced Service Registration System Implementation

## Overview
I've implemented a comprehensive service registration system for providers with the following key features:

### ‚úÖ Features Implemented

#### 1. **Enhanced Service Registration**
- **Multiple Subcategory Selection**: Providers can select multiple subcategories from a single category
- **Flexible Pricing Options**: 
  - Bulk pricing: Set same price for all selected services
  - Individual pricing: Set custom price and details for each subcategory
- **Price Validation**: Automatic validation against subcategory min/max price ranges
- **Service Details**: Custom service names and descriptions for each subcategory

#### 2. **Mandatory License Upload**
- **File Upload**: Secure file upload to Supabase storage
- **Document Types**: Supports PDF, JPG, PNG, DOC, DOCX
- **Storage Security**: Files stored in organized folders by provider
- **Admin Access**: Admins can view all license documents

#### 3. **Working Hours Management**
- **Weekly Schedule**: Set availability for each day of the week
- **Time Slots**: Define start and end times for each available day
- **Flexible Schedule**: Enable/disable specific days

#### 4. **Admin Approval Workflow**
- **Pending Status**: All new services start as 'pending'
- **Admin Review**: Comprehensive admin interface for service approval
- **Approval Notes**: Admins can add notes when approving/rejecting
- **Status Tracking**: Services can be approved, rejected, or pending

#### 5. **Enhanced Provider Dashboard**
- **Real-time Stats**: Live data from database (no local storage)
- **Booking Management**: View recent bookings and earnings
- **Service Status**: Track approval status of all services
- **Profile Completion**: Progress tracking and action items
- **Performance Metrics**: Ratings, earnings, completion rates

### üìÅ Files Created/Modified

#### New Components:
- `ServiceRegistration.tsx` - Enhanced multi-service registration
- `ServiceApprovalManager.tsx` - Admin approval interface
- `checkbox.tsx` - UI component for multi-selection

#### Enhanced Components:
- `ProviderOverview.tsx` - Comprehensive dashboard with real data
- `ProviderSidebar.tsx` - Fixed overlapping Quick Actions

#### Database Schema:
- `update-provider-services-schema.sql` - Database updates for new features

#### Types:
- `categories.ts` - Updated with working hours and new fields

### üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema Updates

Run the following SQL in your Supabase SQL editor:

```sql
-- Add working hours and other fields to provider_services table
ALTER TABLE provider_services 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS working_hours JSONB DEFAULT '{}',
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS approval_notes TEXT,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS approved_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS approved_by UUID REFERENCES user_profiles(id);

-- Create storage bucket for license documents
INSERT INTO storage.buckets (id, name, public)
VALUES ('documents', 'documents', true)
ON CONFLICT (id) DO NOTHING;

-- Create RLS policies for documents bucket
CREATE POLICY "Users can upload their own documents" ON storage.objects
FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own documents" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (bucket_id = 'documents' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);

CREATE POLICY "Admins can view all documents" ON storage.objects
FOR SELECT USING (
  bucket_id = 'documents' AND 
  EXISTS (
    SELECT 1 FROM user_profiles 
    WHERE user_id = auth.uid() AND role = 'admin'
  )
);
```

### üöÄ How It Works

#### For Service Providers:
1. **Navigate to Services**: Go to "My Services" from the sidebar
2. **Register Services**: Click "Add New Service" 
3. **Select Category**: Choose a service category
4. **Select Subcategories**: Check multiple subcategories to offer
5. **Choose Pricing Mode**: 
   - Bulk: Same price for all services
   - Individual: Custom pricing per service
6. **Upload License**: Mandatory license document upload
7. **Set Working Hours**: Define availability schedule
8. **Submit for Approval**: Services go to admin for review

#### For Admins:
1. **Access Admin Panel**: Use the ServiceApprovalManager component
2. **Review Pending Services**: See all services awaiting approval
3. **View License Documents**: Click to view uploaded licenses
4. **Approve/Reject**: Make decisions with optional notes
5. **Track All Services**: Monitor all provider services

#### For End Users:
- Only approved services are visible to customers
- Services show provider details, pricing, and availability
- Working hours determine booking availability

### üîß Key Features

2. **Test Registration Flow**: Try registering services as a provider
3. **Test Admin Approval**: Use admin interface to approve services
